  - `organizationIds[]`: Array of all organization memberships
  - `organizations{}`: Map of organization roles and permissions

- Memory filtering checks both `organizations` map and `organizationIds` array
- Added `getUsersByOrganization()` method for explicit org filtering

### 4. **Security Rules Updates** ✅
