## 3. Test Environment Strategy

### 3.1 Frontend Testing Stack
- **Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Mocking**: Vitest mocks for Firebase, external APIs
- **Coverage**: Vitest coverage reports
- **Target**: 80% minimum code coverage

### 3.2 Backend Testing Stack
- **Framework**: Jest with TypeScript
- **Mocking**: Jest mocks for Firebase Admin, external services
- **Database**: Firebase Emulator Suite
- **Integration**: Real Firebase services in test environment
- **Target**: 85% minimum code coverage

### 3.3 Test Data Strategy
- **Factory Pattern**: Test data generators for consistent fixtures
- **Isolation**: Each test creates/cleans its own data
- **Realistic Data**: Representative of production scenarios
- **Multi-tenant**: Tests verify data isolation between accounts

## 4. Performance Testing Requirements

Based on PRD Non-Functional Requirements:

| Metric | Requirement | Test Approach |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| API Response Time | < 200ms average, < 500ms 95th | Load testing with k6 |
| Page Load Time | < 2 seconds for dashboards | Lighthouse CI integration |
| Concurrent Users | 500+ simultaneous users | Stress testing scenarios |
| Database Queries | < 100ms for standard queries | Query performance tests |
| Report Generation | < 5 seconds for standard reports | Report performance tests |
| File Upload | Support up to 100MB | Upload stress tests |

## 5. Security Testing Requirements

| Security Aspect | Test Coverage | Implementation |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Authentication | JWT validation, session management | Unit + E2E tests |
| Authorization | RBAC permissions, scope validation | Rules tests |
| Data Encryption | TLS 1.3 transit, AES-256 at rest | Integration tests |
| Input Validation | SQL injection, XSS prevention | Security unit tests |
| Audit Logging | All modifications logged | Audit trail tests |
| Session Security | 30-minute idle timeout | Session management tests |
| Password Policy | 12+ chars, complexity rules | Validation tests |

## 6. Cross-Browser and Localization Testing

### 6.1 Browser Support Matrix
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

### 6.2 Localization Testing
- **English** (primary): Full feature testing
- **Arabic**: RTL layout, font rendering, date formats
- **Russian**: Cyrillic support, currency formatting

## 7. Test Execution Strategy

### 7.1 Continuous Integration
- **Unit Tests**: Run on every commit
- **Integration Tests**: Run on PR creation
- **E2E Tests**: Run nightly and before deployment
- **Performance Tests**: Run weekly and before releases

### 7.2 Test Priorities
- **Critical**: Authentication, payment processing, data integrity
- **High**: Core business workflows, user management
- **Medium**: Reporting, notifications, UI components
- **Low**: Edge cases, nice-to-have features

## 8. Test Coverage Targets

| Component | Coverage Target | Justification |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Authentication | 95% | Security critical |
| Payment Processing | 95% | Business critical |
| Core Business Logic | 90% | Revenue impacting |
| API Endpoints | 85% | Integration points |
| UI Components | 80% | User experience |
| Utility Functions | 85% | Foundation code |

## 9. Known Testing Limitations

1. **Real Payment Gateway Testing**: Limited to sandbox environments
2. **Email Delivery**: Testing uses mock SMTP in CI
3. **VoIP Integration**: Phase 3 feature, mock implementation for now
4. **Multi-region Testing**: Single region deployment initially
5. **Load Testing**: Limited to development quotas for external services

## 10. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Firebase Emulator Issues | High | Fallback to test project |
| External API Rate Limits | Medium | Mock responses in CI |
| Test Data Conflicts | Medium | Isolated test datasets |
| Browser Compatibility | Low | Automated cross-browser testing |
| Performance Regression | High | Automated performance monitoring |
